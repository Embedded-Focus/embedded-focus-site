## Embedded Software Development with DevSecOps

With years of experience in embedded software development, CI/CD automation, build process optimization, and embedded security, I help companies improve their development workflows and meet compliance requirements. Whether you're dealing with slow builds, unstable pipelines, inefficient testing strategies, or regulatory and security challenges, I provide robust and scalable solutions tailored to your specific needs.

## Areas of Expertise

### Build Process Architecture

- **CI/CD Optimization and Automation**: Designing, scaling, and automating continuous integration and deployment pipelines for embedded software, including efficient build processes.
- **Test Strategies and Containerized Workflows**: Developing effective test automation solutions and leveraging Docker and container technologies for scalable and reproducible build and test environments.

### Modernizing Legacy Embedded Software Systems

- **Porting and Refactoring Existing Software**: Migrating to modern toolchains, improving C/C++ codebases for better maintainability, security, and performance.
- **Automation and Reproducibility**: Implementing CI/CD, containerization, and reproducible build processes to ensure a stable and scalable development environment.

### Compliance and Security Assurance

- **Embedded Security & Automated Compliance Testing**: Implementing secure development practices and integrating security and quality checks into the build process.
- **Documentation and Software Supply Chain Security**: Supporting compliance documentation, traceability, and ensuring the integrity of dependencies (e.g., SBOM, code signing).

## How I Can Help

I help companies identify bottlenecks, eliminate inefficiencies, and implement best practices in their software development processes. Whether you need hands-on implementation, a strategic assessment of your CI/CD pipelines, or training for your team, I tailor my services to your needs.

### Typical Engagements

**CI/CD Assessment & Strategy: Identifying Bottlenecks and Unlocking Optimization Potential**  
I analyze your CI/CD pipeline, pinpoint inefficiencies, and develop a strategy to make your development process more efficient, stable, and scalable.

**Implementation & Automation: Reliable and Reproducible Build Processes**  
I automate error-prone workflows, optimize build environments, and integrate containerized workflows to ensure stable and reproducible development and testing processes.

**Scaling CI/CD for Embedded Systems: More Builds, Less Waiting**  
I set up on-demand GitLab Runners, optimize resource distribution, and enable parallel builds to reduce build times and improve development efficiency.

**Modernizing Legacy Embedded Software: Future-Proof Development Tools and Architectures**  
I assist in migrating to modern toolchains, improving maintainability of legacy C/C++ code, and optimizing build systems for long-term stability.

**Security & Compliance Assurance: Integrating Security from the Start**  
I implement automated security checks, assist with code signing, and ensure regulatory requirements such as IEC 62443 and the Cyber Resilience Act are met early in the development process.

## Why Work With Me?

I understand the unique challenges of embedded software development and have a proven track record of helping companies improve their CI/CD pipelines. My focus is on delivering practical, scalable, and secure solutions that drive efficiency and reliability in your development process.
