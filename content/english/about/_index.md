I specialize in making development processes in the embedded software industry more efficient, scalable, and secure. With deep expertise in **DevSecOps**, **Continuous Integration and Delivery**, **software development**, and **process automation**, I help companies optimize their product development and future-proof their workflows.

My knowledge of safety- and security-critical applications (e.g., **IEC 62443**, **Cyber Resilience Act**), along with expertise in modern processes and technologies such as **GitOps**, **containerization**, and contemporary programming languages, enables me to craft tailored solutions. I also focus on modernizing legacy technologies, including older C/C++ applications, ensuring both operational security and protection against threats, while fostering innovation and reducing costs.

Whether itâ€™s analyzing and modernizing existing processes, building new CI/CD pipelines, or providing targeted training, I focus on delivering sustainable, measurable results. My approach is pragmatic, cost-effective, and designed to empower teams, minimize risks, and drive long-term success.
