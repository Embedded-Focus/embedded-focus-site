I specialize in making development processes in the embedded software industry more efficient, scalable, and secure. With extensive expertise in **Embedded CI/CD**, **software development**, and **process automation**, I help companies optimize their development cycles and prepare for the future. My knowledge of safety and security-critical applications (e.g., **IEC 62443**, **CRA**) and modern technologies such as **GitOps**, **Docker**, and **Rust** but also with modernizing legacy technologies such as older C/C++ applications enables tailored solutions that foster innovation and reduce costs.

Whether itâ€™s analyzing and modernizing existing processes, building new CI/CD pipelines, or providing targeted training, I focus on delivering measurable and sustainable results. My approach is pragmatic, cost-effective, and designed to empower teams, minimize risks, and guide companies toward long-term success.

**Together, we shape the future of your embedded development.**
