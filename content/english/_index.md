    - "\"Our code is so fragile that every change feels risky\" – technical debt keeps growing, security vulnerabilities go unnoticed, and both product quality and innovation suffer."
    - "\"Fixing bugs and security issues takes too long.\" – this increases support costs, jeopardizes compliance, and forces the team to spend more time firefighting than actually developing."
    - "\"Our variants and dependencies constantly cause problems\" – the system becomes harder to manage, development slows down, and innovation grinds to a halt."
    - "\"Outdated processes frustrate our best people\" – experienced developers leave, onboarding becomes more difficult, and critical know-how gets lost."

    bulletpoints:
    - You spend less time on manual builds and testing because automation eliminates error-prone tasks and reduces waiting times.
    - Your team can focus on real development work, as well-structured pipelines and processes minimize back-and-forth questions, misunderstandings, and unnecessary meetings.
    - Compliance with standards like the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) or IEC 62443 is handled automatically through generated compliance reports, eliminating the need for tedious manual updates in Excel sheets and documentation.
    - Developers feel confident making code changes again, as robust testing and versioning systems provide immediate feedback and prevent regressions.

    bulletpoints:
    - "Faster and more reliable software releases: I develop automated CI/CD pipelines that accelerate build, test, and deployment processes, so your team no longer has to wait hours for product-builds and can roll out new features with confidence."
    - "Modernizing legacy software without disrupting production: I help companies future-proof their legacy code with modern technologies like containerization, automation, or programming languages like Rust—without interrupting operations or breaking existing interfaces."
    - "Bringing DevOps into practice: I train your team in modern DevOps methodologies, ensuring that automation, version control, and testing strategies work seamlessly together—so no one has to rely on manual deployments anymore."
    - "Effortless compliance: I develop processes that automatically generate compliance reports for IEC 62443, IEC 61508, IEC 26262, and the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)—eliminating manual documentation and providing audit-ready reports at the push of a button."
