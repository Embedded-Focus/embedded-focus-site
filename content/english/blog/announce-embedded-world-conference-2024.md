We are showcasing how parallel testing with embedded systems significantly boosts test execution efficiency, especially when strategically scaling the number of devices under test.

## Introduction {#introduction}

As we prepare for the [Embedded World Conference 2024](https://www.embedded-world.de/en/conferences-programme/embedded-world-conference) in Nuremberg, we are excited to share our advancements in the field of software testing. Our recent developments focus on improving test execution performance, particularly in the context of embedded system development. This initiative is not just about innovation; it's about providing practical solutions to longstanding challenges in software testing.


## Improving Test Execution Time {#improving-test-execution-time}

Our approach revolves around the implementation of parallel testing using additional devices. By treating the distribution of tests as a one-dimensional cutting stock problem, we've developed an algorithm that effectively allocates test items across multiple worker nodes. This method has been integrated into established frameworks like [pytest](https://pytest.org/) and [labgrid](https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid), facilitating a seamless transition to more efficient testing processes.

While our methodology has demonstrated significant improvements in test execution times, it's important to recognize the 'speedup ceiling.' This factor determines when the increase in the number of devices under test (DUTs) no longer proportionally reduces test times. For example, in our scenario we observed that increasing DUTs beyond 8 offers diminishing returns in terms of speedup. This highlights the necessity of strategic test optimization alongside parallel testing.

Our data vividly illustrates the impact of our methodology on testing efficiency:

-   Employing 4 DUTs resulted in a 3.36 times speedup.
-   With 8 DUTs, the speedup factor reached 5.22 times.
-   Beyond 8 DUTs, the rate of improvement begins to plateau.

These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in reducing test execution times, particularly in environments where rapid testing is essential.


## Conclusion and Outlook {#conclusion-and-outlook}

Our experience at honeytreeLabs has reaffirmed the importance of continuous innovation in software testing. Looking ahead, we plan to refine our approach by incorporating dynamic feedback loops that use historical test data for optimizing test execution strategies. This evolution will focus not just on speed but also on precision and relevance, ensuring that our methodologies remain effective in an ever-changing technological landscape.

Join us at [Embedded World Conference 2024](https://www.embedded-world.de/en/conferences-programme/embedded-world-conference) to dive deeper into these topics. We are committed to driving advancements that resonate with the needs of the tech community and contribute to more efficient and effective software development processes. ðŸ˜ƒ
